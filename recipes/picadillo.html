        <li>1â€‰&frac12; pounds lean ground beef</li>
        <li>2 cups dry red wine</li>
        <li>1 (15 ounce) can tomato sauce</li>
        <li>&frac23; cup pimiento-stuffed green olives, drained and chopped</li>
        <li>&frac12; cup capers, drained</li>
        <li>&frac14; cup golden raisins</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ground cumin</li>
        <li>1 pinch dried oregano</li>
        <li>&frac14; teaspoon black pepper</li>

    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Place the potatoes into a large pot with enough water to cover; season with salt. Bring the water to a boil;
            reduce heat to medium-low, place a cover on the pot, and cook the potatoes at a simmer until tender, about 20 minutes. Drain and set aside to cool.
        </li>
        &nbsp;
        <li>
            Heat 2 tablespoons olive oil in a large Dutch oven over medium heat; cook and stir the onion, green bell pepper,
            and garlic in the hot oil until the vegetables soften, about 5 minutes.
        </li>
        &nbsp;
        <li>
            Crumble the ground beef into the onion mixture, breaking the meat into smaller pieces as you mix;
            cook and stir until the beef is completely browned, 7 to 10 minutes. Drain as much fat from the mixture as possible.
        </li>
        &nbsp;
        <li>
            Stir the red wine, tomato sauce, olives, capers, golden raisins, cumin, oregano, black pepper,
            and 1/4 teaspoon salt into the ground beef mixture. Bring to a boil, reduce heat to medium-low, and cook at a simmer until the wine had reduced significantly, 25 to 30 minutes.
        </li>
        &nbsp;
        <li>Peel the cooled potatoes and cut into chunks.</li>
        &nbsp;
        <li>Heat 1 teaspoon olive oil in a skillet over medium heat. Cook the potatoes in the hot oil until browned, about 5 minutes.</li>
        &nbsp;
        <li>Gently fold the cooked potatoes into the simmering ground beef mixture; cook together 5 minutes.</li>
    </ol>
